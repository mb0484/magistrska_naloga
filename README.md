This reporsitoty contains code used in development of various language models used in master thesis project: Adaptation of large language models for grammar correction in Slovene. 

Below, you will find an overview of the directories and their contents:

## crkovalnik

The `crkovalnik` directory contains the source code for a web application that serves as a grammar checker and spelling correction tool.

## priprava_ucne_mnozice

The `priprava_ucne_mnozice` directory contains all the scripts used in the construction of a training dataset for training language models.

## magistrska_naloga

The `magistrska_naloga` directory contains the full text of the master's thesis related to this project.

## GoogleColabSkripte

The `GoogleColabSkripte` directory contains scripts that were used for testing and training specific models. Notably, we trained the SloBERT model using these scripts. 

## Other scripts

We also used the `train_model.py` script to train a T5 model for spelling correction. We tested T5 spelling correction model on the Å¡olar corpus using the `test_with_solar.py` script.

## All trained models

All trained models are accessible via following url: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LpS419-fwsK1_xbD6jVFg_Xys-eUwrJE?usp=share_link.
